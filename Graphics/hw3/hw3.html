<H3>1.0 Abstract</H3>
We use a interactive interface to create Hermite curves and Bezier curves(*) for interpolating set of points.<br>
<H3>2.0 Idea of the codes</H3>
For set of points, we create a curve for each pair of contiguous points. At the beginning, we assign a default tangent vector for each of them. It will be (1, 1) for the first and the last point, and P(n+1)-P(n-1) on the Point P(n). Later, you can adjust them by dragging the associated arrows in Hermite case or associated control points in Bezier case.<br><br>
Part of the interface is based on code 'DrawTest.java', the fomulae to compute Hermite and Bezier curve is based on the Graphics textbook by Foley.<br><br>
<H3>3.0 Welcome to <a href="t/example1.html">Program Demo</a>, you can click the mouse
 button to append a point and drag to adjust the curves.</H3>
