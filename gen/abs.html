<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
We propose a new framework for shape representation
and scenery shape selection.
Various topics including figure/ground separation, shape axis construction,
junction detection and illusory figure finding will be discussed.
</p>

<p>
The model construction is inspired by the Gestalt studies.
They suggest proximity, convexity,
symmetry, etc, as cues for
figure/ground separation and visual organization.
By our distributed systems,
we quantify those attributes for complete/partial shapes and
use them for shape evaluations and representations.
In particular, the shape convexity
instead of other well-studied shape
attributes such as the symmetry axis or size,
will be emphasized.
</p>

<p>
Two models are proposed.
The decay diffusion process
is applied in predicting
figure/ground phenomenon, based on a convexity measure
for figure/ground sharing the same area.
The orientation diffusion process,
adopting orientation information on shape boundaries/edges,
will discuss the figure/ground separation or shape convexity comparison
for regions not owning the same size.
A Kullback-Leibler convexity measure
is proposed, with a flexible scenario.
Through a parameter,
we are allowed to choose between a size-invariant convexity
measure or one with small-size preference.
For convexity comparison of perfectly convex shapes,
a preference of circles over triangles
will be given, as well as
the preference of squares over rectangles.
These two models are also used in generating the symmetry information.
In particular, the symmetry information
suggested by the orientation process is computed
by only local operations.
The junction information will be derived similarly,
where junctions are considered no more than ``boundary axis points''.
</p>

<p>
Our framework, based on variational formulations will produce
the static-state results.
The simulation is continuous, rely on
no artificial binary thresholds.
For convexity measurement,
other than the mathematical 0-1 definition,
we distinguish between ``more'' or ``less'' convex shapes.
For axis construction,
we provide the information which continuously describes
strength of the axes for natural axis pruning.
For junction detection, the transition
from low-curvature or high-curvature curves to
curves with a discontinuous curvature
will be seen.
</p>

<p>
The decay diffusion process,
with help of the convexity/entropy measure will also be applied
in shape selection.
Hence, our framework integrally combining many different functions
is useful as a universal low- to middle-level
vision simulation.
